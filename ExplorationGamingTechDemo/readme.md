# Exploration Gaming Tech Demo
Visual Effects Graph
<p>This is a project created using the new Unity technology called the Visual Effects Graph. As a group project, we worked to understand the tool and create a workable demonstration to show the functionality of it. For this project I worked on the orbiting planets and the code that displays the particles.</p>

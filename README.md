Personal &amp; School Projects for Demonstration

### Contents
This repository has been created for the purpose of demonstrating projects and code snippets. It includes files from a number of different projects:
 * [Final project for Intro to Computer Graphics](GraphicsProjectFinal)
 * [Game created for Intro to Game Programming](IntroGameProgrammingProject)
 * [Technology Demo from Exploration and Gaming Tech](ExplorationGamingTechDemo)
 
Each of these projects spans languages, programs, and purposes. These projects were created for different courses taken in the last 2 years and demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages and tools including Java, C#, OpenGL, and the Unity game engine. Both of the game projects come included with builds that are ready to run and the original source Unity project files. The Graphics project comes with the original source files as well.

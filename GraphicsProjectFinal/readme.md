# Intro to Computing Graphics Final Project
<p>Included here is the final project I created for Intro to Computing Graphics. It was programmed entirely in OpenGL using JOGL, the Java OpenGL library. This essentially translates from java to the native C++ code used to run OpenGL. While I did not actually use C++ to program this project it includes all of the same steps that would go into creating a normal OpenGL programming including allocating memory for buffers, creating shaders, and more.</p>
<p>On this project I adapted code written for other projects created throughout the semester into one that incorporated primitives, texture and normal mapping, lighting, shadows, orbiting objects, importing models, and skyboxes. Graphics Programming has proven to be one of my favorite types of programming to date, and I really enjoy the low leve control I can have over the end product.</p>
